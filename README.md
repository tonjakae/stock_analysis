# Stock Analysis: VBA Challenge
## Purpose
In this challenge, I’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that I did in this module. Then, I’ll determine whether refactoring my code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, I’ll present a written analysis that explains my findings.

# Deliverable 1: Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance
## Step 1a:
* Create a tickerIndex variable and set it equal to zero before iterating over all the rows. You will use this tickerIndex to access the correct index across the four different arrays you’ll be using: the tickers array and the three output arrays you’ll create in Step 1b.
## Step 1b:
* Create three output arrays: tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices.
* The tickerVolumes array should be a Long data type.
* The tickerStartingPrices and tickerEndingPrices arrays should be a Single data type.
