## VBA Challenge
### Purpose
In this challenge, I’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that I did in this module. Then, I’ll determinewhether refactoring my code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, I’ll present a written analysis that explains my findings.
